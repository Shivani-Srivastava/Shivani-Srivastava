 👋 Hi, I’m @Shivani-Srivastava
 
 👀 I’m interested in monitoring, mapping and valuing Ecosystem Services! 
  (What are they? Anything we as humans enjoy by virtue of the ecology around us)
 
 🌱 I’m currently learning Business Use-Cases for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence :)
 
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on R/Python/Julia projects relying on ML techniques and Spatial data!
