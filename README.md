 👋 Hi, I’m @Shivani-Srivastava
 
 👀 I’m interested in monitoring, mapping and valuing Human Experiences! (These include those with tangible products and non-tangible ones, like recreation or relief.)
 
 ✨ Also inclining towards research exploring how online user-generated content can help shape real-world policies and business decisions.
 
 🌱 I’ve explored Business Use-Cases for Machine Learning at Indian School of Business, Hyderabad and learnt to make dynamic web-based tools to exhibit, visualize and communicate relevant complex concepts and applications. Check my repos for more on this. I've also worked at the Council of Energy, Environment and Water as a research intern briefly, to help build an early warning dashboard for air quality drops based on open source satellite data.

✨ I'm currently working as a full-time Business Analyst at Genpact HMS Analytics (India).
 
 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on R/Python/Julia projects that lie in these intersections!
