 👋 Hi, I’m @Shivani-Srivastava
 
 👀 I’m interested in monitoring, mapping and valuing Ecosystem Services! 
  (What are they? Anything we as humans enjoy by virtue of the environment around us.)
 
 ✨ Also inclining towards research exploring how online user-generated content can help shape real-world policies and business decisions.
 
 🌱 I’ve explored Business Use-Cases for Machine Learning at Indian School of Business, Hyderabad and learnt to make dynamic web-based tools to exhibit, visualize and communicate relevant complex concepts and applications. Check my repos for more on this.

✨ I'm currently working as a Researcher at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) in New Delhi, India - exploring the application of Machine Learning methods to evaluate impact of government schemes on Air Pollution.
 
 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on R/Python/Julia projects that lie in these intersections!
